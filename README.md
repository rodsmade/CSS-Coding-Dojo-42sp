# CSS-Coding-Dojo-42sp
This is the first Front End/CSS coding dojo we'll be having @ 42sp!

# Set Up
Challenge __00 - Hello World!__ is an introductory _kata_ that should be used to showcase how to set up the environment for all other challenges to come.
It already contains a fully built HTML page and according CSS styles, with a couple "mistakes" intentionally left behind. Ideally, a more experienced dev will guide the whole group through "fixing" those mistakes so that everyone learns about the relation between html and css files, selectors and styles, and how powerful HTML/CSS alone can be in creating stunning visuals.

> :warning: The goal here is __not__ to recreate anything from scratch! If it seems too hard of a challenge or if it takes more than 15 minutes to be solved, by all means move on to the next challenges as they are designed to start off pretty easy and scale in difficulty gradually.

# Challenges
Every folder in this directory represents a challenge to be conquered in groups.
They all start off as a 'blank canvas' containing an HTML page with a single `<div>`, and its corresponding style defined in the `styles.css` file.
The goal is to use HTML and CSS __ONLY__ in order to reproduce the layouts presented in each directory's `expected_outcome.png` file. Take a good look at it, and let your creativity and problem-solving skills flow!

> :warning: These "`randori`" exercises are meant to be solved by small groups of 3-4 devs, as they rotate the roles of pilot/copilot/audience to solve each problem.

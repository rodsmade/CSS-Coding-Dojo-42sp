# CSS-Coding-Dojo-42sp
This is the first Front End/CSS coding dojo we'll be having @ 42sp!

# Challenges
Every folder in this directory represents a challenge to be conquered in groups. Every challenge folder starts with two base files: `challenge_XX.html` and `styles.css`. These files contain the simplest html/css structure to get you ready to unleash your creativity!

The goal is to use pure HTML and CSS __ONLY__ in order to reproduce the layouts presented in each directory's `expected_outcome` file.

Challenge __00 - Hello World!__ is an introductory _kata_ meant to showcase how the dojo will be conducted.

All the other challenges are _randori_, that is, exercises meant to be solved by small groups of 3-4 devs, as they rotate the roles of pilot/copilot/audience to solve each problem.
